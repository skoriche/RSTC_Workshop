## ðŸ”— External Tools

This workshop includes three integrated tools developed by Saurav-JSU for accessing and analyzing Earth Engine-based climate datasets:

- [GeoClimate-Fetcher](https://github.com/Saurav-JSU/GeoClimate-Fetcher): Download climate data from Google Earth Engine.
- [Index-Visualizer](https://github.com/Saurav-JSU/Index-Visualizer): Calculate and visualize standardized indices.
- [GeeData-GroundData-validator](https://github.com/Saurav-JSU/GeeData-GroundData-validator): Validate GEE climate datasets against in-situ observations.

All tools are included in the `/external/` folder or can be cloned separately.
