# Technical Workshop: Remote Sensing for Water Resources and Water Quality Modeling Applications

**Date**: Sunday, May 18, 2025  
**Time**: 1:00 PM ‚Äì 5:00 PM (Alaska Daylight Time, AKDT)  
**Location**: Room 4  
**PDHs**: 4.0 Professional Development Hours  

**Organized by the [Remote Sensing Applications for TMDL Modeling Task Committee (ASCE) https://bit.ly/RS-TC](https://www.asce.org/communities/institutes-and-technical-groups/environmental-and-water-resources-institute/committees/environmental-and-water-resources-institute/ewri-governing-board/technical-coordination-executive-committee/watershed-council/watershed-management-technical-committee/remote-sensing-applications-for-tmdl-modeling)**

## Workshop Purpose

This interactive workshop introduces participants to satellite-based remote sensing tools and data products relevant to ambient water quality monitoring, watershed modeling, and TMDL applications.

Participants will:
- Gain hands-on experience using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for water resource applications.
- Learn how to access and interpret satellite imagery for climate, sediment, and water quality studies.
- Work through case studies on climate trends, suspended sediment, lake monitoring, and chlorophyll-a (CHLA) estimation.
- Engage with others working in research, policy, and practice to advance remote sensing use in water management.
