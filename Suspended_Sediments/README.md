# Tutorial for Xgboost
This repository contains jupyter notebooks to implement Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using Landsat remote sensing (RS) data. These codes have been written for educational purposes.

### The repo contains two scripts:
1. Xgboost_tutorial.ipynb : Implements xgboost to real world data
2. Xgboost_illustration.ipynb : Illustrates how xgboost approximates a function

### Data 
Data is zipped, please unzip from dataLSTM_SR.txt.zip to dataLSTM_SR.txt
